Hello!

I'm JLC (Joakim L. Christiansen) the author of JLC's Internet TV (now abandoned) and I love programming almost more than anything else in life! That's really my only motivation, I don't program because it's my job (I've never done it as a full time job)...

Actually I can't do it as a profession because I suffer from chronic RSI (repetitive strain injury) and lots of muscle and tendon pain in general, together with severe fatigue, brain fog and memory problems. All this has been undiagnosed now for 15+ years, and my life is a mess because of it...

So no, not every skilled programmer gets to achieve success and a good economy, I'm poor and close to loosing my apartment. But that doesn't stop me from dreaming about it.

If you want to help me out then please become a [sponsor of me here on GitHub](https://github.com/sponsors/JoakimCh) or check my website for [more options](https://joakimch.github.io/funding.html).

I've started tons of projects but I'm mostly too slow (because of RSI) or too tired to finish any of them. But I plan to become better at this and eventually have lots of nice projects to share! My brain is always full of great ideas, I just wish I had a body which could complete them in time.

Oh, and by the way; consciousness is separate from the brain and the physical universe is a construct. I try to tell everybody this because I'm tired of the ignorance and the ridicule when it comes to these subjects.

Have a day full of wonderful! ðŸ™‚
