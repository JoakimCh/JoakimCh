Yo!

I'm JLC (Joakim L. Christiansen), the author of JLC's Internet TV (now abandoned) and I love programming almost more than anything else in life! That's really my only motivation, I don't program because it's my job (I've never done it as a job)...

Actually I can't do it as a profession because I suffer from chronic RSI (repetitive strain injury) and lots of muscle and tendon pain in general, together with severe fatigue, brain fog and memory problems. All this has been undiagnosed now for around 15 years, and my life is a mess because of it...

So no, not every skilled programmer gets to achieve success and a good economy. But that doesn't stop me from dreaming about it!

If you want to help me out then please become a [sponsor of me here on GitHub](https://github.com/sponsors/JoakimCh). Or check my website for [more options](https://joakimch.github.io/funding.html).

I've started tons of projects but I'm mostly too slow or tired to finish any of them, but I plan to become better at this and eventually have lots of nice stuff to share.

Oh, and by the way; consciousness is separate from the brain and the physical universe is a construct. I try to tell everybody this because I'm tired of the ignorance and the ridicule when it comes to these subjects.

Have a day full of wonderful! ðŸ™‚
